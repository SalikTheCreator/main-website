    <h2> About Me </h2>
    <hr>
    <p>

     Born and raised in Sacramento, California with both parents born in Pakistan. 
      Was majoring in Bio-Chemistry and had to drop out due to family complications with only a few classes left from a associate degree.
      Worked in many team settings that include fast food, college science lab classes, and retail stores. 
      Team work leads to many solutions that will inevitably result in better results than always working solo.

<h2> Computer Enthusiast </h2>
   <hr>
  <p>   

    Built a custom computer in 2012 and since the age of two technology has been ingrained into my being.
    At the age of two I was playing video games on a NES and from there on out i ended up spending substantial time on many systems. 
    <ol class="requiredList">
      <li>Sega Dreamcast</li>
      <li>Nintendo 64 </li>
      <li>Sony Playstation 2</li>
      <li>Microsoft Xbox 360 </li>
    </ol>
    Software is just as critical as hardware, hardware without software is a chunk of sillicon and software without hardware is just a mish mash of words and numbers.
    Being part of the machine that progresses technology is my main aspiration, since I already follow technology as a fan.

  <h2> Hard Worker </h2> 
     <hr>

     <p>

      
      Desires equate to nothing without the hard work and dedication.
       Perfection, dedication, working until the job is done with minimal to no breaks is what I am known for. 
      12 hour work schedules with no breaks and complete focus is something I do and will continue to do to achieve my goals.

      <li> Focus </li>
      </ul>
      Music is a powerful, and being able to create music let's you grasp the emotions inside that are hard to express in words. 
      Self reflection with from playing guitar since the age of 15 has been critical to my life.
      Music like many arts is a language that transcends all our prejudices and barriers and temporarily results in petty squabbles being put aside.
