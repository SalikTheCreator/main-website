    <h2> About Me </h2>
   
    <!-- <hr> used throughout to divide content and add some flare -->

    <p>

     Born and raised in Sacramento, California with both parents born in Pakistan. 
      Majored in Bio-Chemistry and had to drop out due to family complications with only a few classes left from a associate degree.
      Worked in many team settings that include fast food, college science lab classes, and retail stores. 
      Team work leads to many solutions that will inevitably result in better results in most scenarios.

    Built a custom computer in 2012, and, since then I have kept track of technology daily.
    At the age of two I was playing video games on a NES and from there on out i ended up spending substantial time on many systems such as: 
 
    <ol class="requiredList">
     
      <li>Sega Dreamcast</li>
      <li>Nintendo 64 </li>
      <li>Sony Playstation 2</li>
      <li>Microsoft Xbox 360 </li>
      <li>Nintendo Switch </li>
 
    </ol>

    Software is just as critical as hardware, hardware without software is a chunk of sillicon and software without hardware is just a mish mash of words and numbers.
    Being part of the machine that progresses technology is my main aspiration so progressing in my knowledge of software engineering is a priority.

        Desires equate to nothing without the hard work and dedication and once I start a job I am dedicated to getting it done.
       I am a perfectionist so I see all the minor imperfections which may result in jobs taking longer but the result always speak for themselves.
      12 hour work schedules detailing cars with no breaks and complete focus is something I do and will continue to do to achieve my goals.

      Music is powerful, and being able to create music let's me grasp the emotions inside that are hard to express in words. 
      Self reflection from playing guitar since the age of 15 has been critical to getting through times in a healthy productive way. 
      Music like many arts is a language that transcends all our prejudices and barriers and temporarily results in petty squabbles being put aside.
